Hello there, Welcome to my GitHub 

I am Maxi Esper, Frontend Developer Jr.
I'm a self-taught IT student, currently learning ReactJS!

Before my discovery of web development, I was working in different jobs since I studied Comunication. That means I can add a differential value when carrying out software development projects.
